So I bought some cactus and succulent seeds and decided to have them germinate all in the same box.

i found a plastic box that is large and long but not that tall. I made a few drain holes in the bottom, used Leca balls as a bottom layer and then added the soil mix made of 50% fine sand and 50% commercial cactus pot mix.

the light system is a cheap strip led grow light giving 12hours of light per day.

Lets see how it goes !
